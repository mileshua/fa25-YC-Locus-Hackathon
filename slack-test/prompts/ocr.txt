I want you to check whether this image is a receipt or invoice.
If it is, extract information about the price of each item and the total price.
- Make sure the name is readable and interpretable. Sometimes the receipt name is not clear, so you should write a simple descriptive, readable name.
- Make sure the price is in dollars.
- Make sure the total is in dollars.
If it is not, say that it is not a receipt.

The format of your response should be in a json object with no reasoning or clarification. It should not use a code block, it should just be in plain text.
It should be in the following format:

{
    "is_receipt": true,
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "Item name",
            "price": <Item price> (float, in dollars)
        }
    ],
    "total": <Total price> (float, in dollars)
}

If it is not a receipt, return the following json object:
{
    "is_receipt": false,
}

Do not write anything other than the json object. Do not put this in a separate code block, simply put it in plain text.
